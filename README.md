## LeetCode Solutions Repository üöÄ

This repository is my personal collection of solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). It serves as a simple log of my progress. 

## üìÅ Repository Structure

To maintain clarity and make navigation easy, the solutions are organized numerically. The structure is designed to help you find any problem quickly:

-   **Main Folders (`0001-0100`, `0101-0200`, etc.):** Problems are grouped into ranges of 100.
-   **Sub-Folders/Packages (`0001-0010`, `0011-0020`, etc.):** Within each main folder, problems are further organized into smaller groups of 10.
-   **Solution Files:** Each file is named after the LeetCode problem title (e.g., `TwoSum.cs`).
-   **Problem Reference:** Inside each file, comments clearly indicate the corresponding problem number.

## üí° About the Solutions

My primary goal is to find a correct and clear solution for each problem. While I always aim for efficiency in terms of time and space complexity, some solutions may represent my initial passing attempt.
